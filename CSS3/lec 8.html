 <h3>Static Position</h3>

Default position for all elements.
<br>
Follows the normal flow of the document.

<h3>Relative Position</h3>
Moves an element relative to its original position.
<br>

Does not affect the surrounding elements.

 <h3>Absolute Position</h3>

Moves an element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (or the viewport if none exists).
<br>

Removes the element from the normal document flow.

<h3>Fixed Position</h3>
Positions the element relative to the viewport.
<br>

Stays in place during scrolling.


 <h3>Sticky Position</h3>

A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
<br>

Stays relative until a specified scroll position is reached, then becomes fixed.
